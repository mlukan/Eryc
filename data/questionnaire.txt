**Dear Donor,**  

Thank you in advance for your willingness to donate blood, plasma, or blood cells.  

Before the donation, we will examine your blood count, blood pressure, body temperature (if necessary), and you will undergo a medical examination.  

In the collected blood, we will test for:  
- Blood group  
- Antibodies against the hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc), its surface antigen (HBsAg), and HBV DNA  
- Antibodies against the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and HCV RNA  
- Antibodies against the AIDS virus (anti-HIV), HIV p24 antigen, and HIV RNA  
- Syphilis tests  

We will inform you of the results of these tests only if they affect your eligibility to donate blood or if additional tests are needed.  

These tests are intended to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases through donated blood. In some cases, especially with recent infections, test results may be negative even though the infection could still be transmitted to a blood transfusion recipient. Therefore, it is essential that you answer each of the following questions truthfully. If you have any doubts, you can consult a doctor from our department.  

If you withhold any information, you may put blood transfusion recipients at risk of infection. These tests are not intended to verify your health status; for this purpose, please consult public health authorities.  

We kindly ask you to complete the questionnaire truthfully. This questionnaire is part of the mandatory examination before blood and blood component donation, in accordance with the decree of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic No. 158/2015 Coll. on the requirements for the correct practice of transfusion medicine.
